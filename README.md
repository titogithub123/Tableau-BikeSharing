# Tableau-BikeSharing

## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to help determine if a bike sharing business opportunity was a good idea for Des Moines, Iowa using information from Citibike bike sharing services in New York City.

Specifically, there are (3) threee main questions we would like to answer. 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

In addition, we weill add visualizations that will hopefully go a long way towards making our analysis as clear as possible to potential stake holders. 

## Results
 From our analysis we were able to discover some interesting facts about bike sharing users in New York City. Below are some of the highlights. 
 
 1) Here we can see the total number of trips complteted for the month of August broken down by user type, (Customer or Subscriber).

2) Next, we can see the peak hours riders like to take their bikes out for a spin. As is evident by the graph it appears 7am and 6-7pm are the most popular times.

3) Here we have a map of all the start stations from where rider began their journeys throughout the day. From the image we can see that the majority of stations are located on the island of Manhattan.

7) Lastly, we have the trip numbers count by age. From the graph we can see that 25-30 year olds are the group that is much more likely to take advantage of the bike sharing eco-system.

## Summary
As we can see from the analysis, a bike sharing program is very popluar in a city like New York because of the population density. There are many places people can start and end a bike ride journery. From our analysis it seems most folks use the bikes to travel relatively short distances. The question that is still left to be answered is whether or not this would be a good idea for a place like, Des Moines, Iowa. 

If possible, it would be nice to further the study the following (2) two points. 

1) We can see here how often riders would be looking for a bike service in Des Monies. From the following image we can see riders sought bikes some 526,424 times. An extremely large number. Of course, this is New York city, would this kind of demand transfer to Des Moines?

2) The second question we would need to ask is how often will bikes need to come in for service. In New York it looks like on the high end bikes can last approx. 140 trips before coming in for needed repairs. How would this translate in Des Moines?
