# Tableau-BikeSharing

## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to help determine if a bike sharing business opportunity was a good idea for Des Moines, Iowa using information from Citibike bike sharing services in New York City.

Specifically, there are (3) threee main questions we would like to answer. 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

In addition, we weill add visualizations that will hopefully go a long way towards making our analysis as clear as possible to potential stake holders.
